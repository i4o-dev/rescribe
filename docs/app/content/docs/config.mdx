In Rescribe, the CMS and templates can be configured via a `rescribe.config.tsx` file co-located with your `app/root.tsx`. The admin UI (CMS) will be rendered based on your configuration.

We start by creating a config object by calling `config()` from `@rescribejs/core`.

```javascript
export const config = config({
  collections: {
    docs: collection({
      // collection options
    })
  }
})
```
