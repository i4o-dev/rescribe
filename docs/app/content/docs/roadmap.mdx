## In Progress

These are the features/issues that I’m working on right now

### Show only published posts in blog and docs templates

Blog and docs template show any content that it finds. But they should only show content marked as published.

[Github Issue #30](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/30)

### Preview

It’ll be great if users could preview the content they’re writing. This should be a feature in blog and docs layouts. For custom output layouts, preview could be enabled using a dedicated splat route.

[Github Issue #16](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/16)

## Planned Features

### Full MDX support

While we can save files as MDX, the editor and output doesn’t support JSX in MDX files.

[Github Issue #15](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/15)

### i18n

Detect locales in directory names and generate locale selector in the navbar.
