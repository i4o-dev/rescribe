A collection is how you can organize your content. Each key-value in the `collections` object represents a content collection. We can create a collection using `collection()`. You can create as many collections as you want. Each collection can be configured independently.

## Collection Options

Here are the options available for each collection:

### `format`

All content is saved as markdown in your codebase in the local filesystem. The `format` option allows you to either save them as `md` or `mdx` files.

Acceptable values are `‘md’ | ‘mdx'`

### `label`

The label with which you want to identify this collection in the admin UI.

### `slug`

This will be the slug under which you can access the collection in the admin UI.

### `path`

The path where you want to store your content. `path` values could have glob patterns in them.  Rescribe will create any directory or directories — based on the `slug` of a collection item — inside your `app` directory.

Example: `’content/docs/**/*’` or `’content/blog/*’` or \`’content/changelog/\*\*/\*/

### `schema`

This is where you define what fields you want in the editor for each collection, what those fields represent, etc. To learn more about what fields are supported, check [Fields API](/docs/fields/boolean).

For example, this is the schema that the docs in this site uses.

```javascript
schema: {
	title: fields.text({
		label: 'Title',
		description: 'Page Title',
	}),
	content: fields.document({
		label: 'Content',
	}),
	slug: fields.slug({
		label: 'Page URL',
		description: 'URL of the page',
	}),
}
```

Some fields are required by default:

* title - `text` field
* content - `document` field
* slug - `slug` field

All fields except `document` field will be stored in the markdown file’s frontmatter. Content entered in the `document` field will be the content of the markdown file.

*Note: Rescribe automatically creates and updates* `createdAt` *and* `updatedAt` *fields in your frontmatter behind the scenes, so you don’t have to add them.*
